# **ProtoTracer: 3D Rendering and Animation Engine**
This project is a real-time 3D rendering and animation engine designed for use on the Teensy 4.0. It supports 64x32 HUB75 panels, as well as a custom panel design based on WS2812b LEDs.

Before startint this project, it is _highly_ recommended that you have experience with other microcontroller projects first. This is not a simple or easy project to complete, and support can only be provided for issues with the base project, not with your specific setup. If you are looking for a simple, easy solution, please consider:
- Hudu WF-1
  - üó∏ RGB, works with HUB75 panels
  - üó∏ Easy Wi-Fi configuration, quick setup with an app
  - ‚ùå Not interactive, only shows static images
- MAX7219-based Protogen Designs
  - üó∏ Very cheap, readily available on Amazon / alternatives
  - üó∏ Uses an Arduino Nano as a controller
  - üó∏ Interactive (depending on the controller firmware)
  - üó∏ Uses less power than HUB75-based designs
  - ‚ùå Single color, pixels can only be on or off.
  - ‚ùå Lots of soldering required to connect the panels together

## Recommended platform requirements:
- Teensy 4.0 microcontroller
- 2x 64x32 HUB75 panels
- SmartMatrix V4 LED Shield or ProtoController V2 (coming soon)

This codebase has been tested a Teensy 4.0 (2000 triangle scene with a 4,096 pixel matrix).
